This script represents a small server application written in Node.js and using middlewares like express.js, body-parser, and CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

## Module Imports and Constants

Several modules are imported and constants are assigned that aid in setting up the server:

- `express`: The web application framework for Node.js.
- `body-parser`: Middleware for handling incoming request bodies in a middleware before the handlers. Here used for parsing JSON payloads.
- `cors`: Middleware to enable CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing) with various options.
- `PORT`: A constant set to 3000. The server will be running on this port.
- `CORS_CLIENT_ADDRESS`: A constant set to 'http://localhost:63342' where the client is expected to send requests from.

## Application Configuration

Once the server is set up with `express()`, the following middlewares are applied:

- `body-parser`: It parses the JSON payloads of incoming requests.
- `cors`: Applied at the application level, allowing appropriate cross-origin resource sharing for all routes.
- `cors` options for preflight `OPTIONS` requests.

## Message Store (Array)

- `messages`: An array acting as a simple in-memory database to store the messages.

## Route Configuration

- `POST /messages`: This route processes incoming post requests, generates a unique ID for each incoming message, and sends the array of all messages as a response to the client.
- `GET /messages`: This route allows the client to fetch all the messages currently stored in the server. The server responds with a JSON containing all the messages.

## Server Startup

The application will start a server listening on the port as specified by `PORT` and logs a message stating that the server is running and on which port.

This small application is essential in understanding how to implement a messaging API with essential middlewares to process request bodies and handle CORS.

for application running run `npm i` and after that `npm run start` on console in `server` directory
